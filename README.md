# Share Buttons

**IN DEVELOPMENT**: I will post news of release on [my Twitter](http://twitter.com/sunnyismoi) and [my blog](http://sunnyis.me/blog/).

Social share buttons provided by Twitter, Facebook, and others are easy to use but impact the web's performance in a negative way (when used together). Odds are, you only need some fancy links with some icons. This is where this project comes in to help.

Share Buttons allows you to implement simple sharing functionality through HTML, CSS, and JS.
